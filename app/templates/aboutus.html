    <h2>Our Mission</h2>
    <p>The visual media that we consume as a society is indoctrinated with harmful stereotypes concerning marginalized groups, specifically people of color, members of the LGBTQ+ community, and those subjected to gendered social norms. This provides a false and detrimental model for reality, pushing forth various unreasonable and unrealistic expectations and social standards for members of these demographics.</p>
    <p>filmScale aims to provide transparency and statistics regarding any harmful stereotypes and/or themes that appear in the movies that we consume, as well as creating communication between users to share reviews, opinions, and criticisms on certain films regarding its themes and messages.</p>
